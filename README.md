# MAT 385 Project

Tool built for MAT 385 (Discrete Mathematics) at NKU by Will St. Onge and Greyson Fangman. This tool allows the user to encipher/decipher using the playfair and hill ciphers. 

This tool is fairly modular, so it should be easy to expand if one wished to add support for other ciphers (caesar, multiplication, affine, etc.)

The sister tool for the affine cipher exists at [WillStOnge/Affine-Cipher-Breaker](https://github.com/WillStOnge/Affine-Cipher-Breaker).
